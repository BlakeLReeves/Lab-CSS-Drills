            <h2>The Hobbit</h2>
            <p>A great modern
                <span style="color: red; font-weight: 600;">classic</span> and the prelude to THE LORD OF THE RINGS. Bilbo Baggins is a hobbit who enjoys a comfortable,
                unambitious life, rarely traveling any farther than his pantry or cellar. But his contentment is disturbed
                when the wizard Gandalf and a company of dwarves arrive on his doorstep one day to whisk him away on an adventure.
                They have launched a plot to raid the treasure hoard guarded by Smaug the Magnificent, a large and very dangerous
                dragon. Bilbo reluctantly joins their quest, unaware that on his journey to the Lonely Mountain he will encounter
                both a magic ring and a frightening creature known as Gollum.</p>

            <h2>The Fellowship of the Ring</h2>
            <p>In
                <span style="color: red; font-weight: 600;">ancient</span> times the Rings of Power were crafted by the Elven-smiths, and Sauron, the Dark Lord, forged
                the One Ring, filling it with his own power so that he could rule all others. But the One Ring was taken
                from him, and though he sought it throughout Middle-earth, it remained lost to him. After many ages it fell
                into the hands of Bilbo Baggins, as told in The Hobbit. In a sleepy village in the Shire, young Frodo Baggins
                finds himself faced with an immense task, as his elderly cousin Bilbo entrusts the Ring to his care. Frodo
                must leave his home and make a perilous journey across Middle-earth to the Cracks of Doom, there to destroy
                the Ring and foil the Dark Lord in his evil purpose.</p>

            <h2>The Two Towers</h2>
            <p>Frodo and his
                <span style="color: red; font-weight: 600;">Companions</span> of the Ring have been beset by danger during their quest to prevent the Ruling Ring from
                falling into the hands of the Dark Lord by destroying it in the Cracks of Doom. They have lost the wizard,
                Gandalf, in a battle in the Mines of Moria. And Boromir, seduced by the power of the Ring, tried to seize
                it by force. While Frodo and Sam made their escape, the rest of the company was attacked by Orcs. Now they
                continue the journey alone down the great River Anduin—alone, that is, save for the mysterious creeping figure
                that follows wherever they go</p>

            <h2>The Return of the King</h2>
            <p>As the Shadow of
                <span style="color: red; font-weight: 600;">Mordor</span> grows across the land, the Companions of the Ring have become involved in separate adventures.
                Aragorn, revealed as the hidden heir of the ancient Kings of the West, has joined with the Riders of Rohan
                against the forces of Isengard, and takes part in the desperate victory of the Hornburg. Merry and Pippin,
                captured by Orcs, escape into Fangorn Forest and there encounter the Ents. Gandalf has miraculously returned
                and defeated the evil wizard, Saruman. Sam has left his master for dead after a battle with the giant spider,
                Shelob; but Frodo is still alive—now in the foul hands of the Orcs. And all the while the armies of the Dark
                Lord are massing as the One Ring draws ever nearer to the Cracks of Doom.</p>
